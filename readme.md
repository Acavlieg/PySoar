# PySoar

PySoar automates the analysis of glider competitions. It starts with a Soaring Spot URL and delivers a spreadsheet as output.

## Stand alone versions
Stand alone versions for Windows, Mac and Linux are available under [releases](https://github.com/GliderGeek/PySoar/releases).

Apart from Excel/Open Office for viewing the spreadsheet, no extra software is needed.

## Limitations
The following limitations are (currently) in place:

- no AAT
- no restart after 1st turnpoint
- no penalties for missing turnpoints -> outlanding
- no multiple start points


## Development
For development, the following steps need to be taken:

1. Install python requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
