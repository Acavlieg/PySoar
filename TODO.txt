- setup.py to get appropriate packages
- branching with development / features etc?
- self.b=[] -> b=[], self.b = b , for speed reasons
- earth radius inside get_distance? only place where used?
- eliminate det_ vs determine_ in general functions
- always settings object at top of file?
- eliminate defaults in top of determine_phases (only for first run)
